# Introduction #

This page is to collect a list of websites which are distributing binary versions of iNdependence as part of their iPhone unlocking service, but are not making the source code publicly available (nor giving credit).  If you know of any others, please submit them here.

This also includes sites which are distributing ZiPhone without source code.  Although ZiPhone is not my application, large parts of it are based off of GPLed code (one example: the SIM unlocking app within it uses GPL code that was originally part of anySIM).  By virtue of that fact, ZiPhone is also covered under the GPL.  So while I have no right to enforce the license for ZiPhone, I will still point out sites which are distributing it without making any source publicly available.

I'm being strict about this because the only reason we've come to this point with the iPhone (being able to fully unlock it) is because people have been open with information.  Now we get a bunch of profiteers who simply want to repackage everything and sell it without respecting the licenses of what they are distributing.  I'm not against the sale of the software + support to go with it, but these people need to be aware that, in exchange for the ability to profit from the work of others, they must share back to the community any new work they add to it.  This is the reason the GPL was created.

It's not about getting money from anyone, or trying to make people look bad, it's about moving knowledge forward as a group rather than duplicating effort by making all of our work private.  If the original developers had taken this approach, there would be no such market to make profits from, and we'd have a bunch of fragmented efforts with a lot less success.
