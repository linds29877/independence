  * [The iPhone Dev Wiki (Mirror)](http://iphonedevwiki.scribblewiki.com/Main_Page) - A mirror of the site that started it all for me.  Lots of great technical information and history there.

  * [The Hackint0sh iPhone Forums](http://hackint0sh.org/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=123) - Started up around the same time as the iPhone Dev Wiki, so again, a wealth of information and helpful people here.

  * [iPhone Dev Team Portal](http://iphone-dev.org/) - Site for the original iPhone dev team.  The people who started it all.

  * [iPhone Elite Dev Team](http://code.google.com/p/iphone-elite/) - The elite iPhone dev team.  Used to be quite active and open with information.

  * [Geohot's Blog](http://iphonejtag.blogspot.com/) - Geohot is the first person to have a SIM unlocked iPhone (outside of Apple).  Knows the iPhone hardware as well as the Apple engineers.  Though his software skills are still in question... (hey, I cleaned up bits of the fake IPSF server code for my own use, so I've seen his code) ;)

  * [George Zhu's Blog](http://george.zjlotto.com/) - No, this is not Geohot's blog! ;)  But it's still a good resource for understanding the technical details behind iPhone hacking discoveries.

  * [The Touchdev Wiki](http://www.touchdev.net/wiki/Main_Page) - Same structure as the iPhone Dev Wiki, but for the iPod Touch (or iTouch) (defunct).

  * [iPhone Toolchain Project Page](http://code.google.com/p/iphone-dev/) - Essential for iPhone application developers.  Just make sure to release a standalone version of your killer iPhone app, ok? ;)

  * [anySIM Project Page](http://code.google.com/p/devteam-anysim/) - The source code for anySIM.  Interesting to me, maybe to you too?

  * [Nate True's iPhone Utils and Info](http://iphone.natetrue.com/) - Nate did a lot of the early iPhone hacking and maintained iBrickr for a while (kinda like iNdependence for Windows with a fancier interface -- I've never been much of a UI tweaker -- I enjoy the technical details more).  Still a useful site for files and technical info.

  * [Erica Sadun's Blog](http://www.tuaw.com/bloggers/erica-sadun/) - Erica is one of the first major iPhone application developers and continues to produce interesting apps for the iPhone.  Not to mention she has a loyal following amongst the sexually frustrated, male-dominated crowd of would-be iPhone hackers.
